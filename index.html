        <!-- I'm Daniel Elkik, a Computer Science student in the Daedalus Scholars
        Program at Hunter College. I became attached to the field after realizing
        the versitality that accompanies coding. Anything is possible as long as
        I have a computer and my fingers to type. I'm interested in both Finance and Game
        Development. My motivation in life is to create projects through the medium
        of video games in order to inspire, and of course entertain, people
        of all ages and countries, especially when life becomes tough.

        Recently, the FDA approved a video game as a prescription for ADHD. </a> This is an incredible
        achievement, one that could finally end the negative stigma that surrounds
        video games and one that I would love to be a part of one day. So until then,
        I will continue coding and creating projects so I can reach this dream of mine. -->
        I'm Daniel Elkik, a Computer Science student in the Daedalus Scholars Program at 
        Hunter College. I'm interested in all things Computer Science including Data Science and 
        Full-Stack Development. The field of CS that I am most interested in is Back-End 
        Development. I love implementing algorithms that will do all the work the user needs. 
        I find it most enjoyable when I need to sit down for hours at a time designing solutions to various problems and then have to figure out 
        what in my code needs to be fixed. The more effort I put into designing and debugging code, 
        the more rewarding it is to finally see my code in action. Outside of work, I enjoy hobbies that 
        invoke these similar feelings. Drawing is one of my hobbies that I enjoy the most due to 
        the amount of effort needed to replicate an image, not only through the way it physically looks, but also 
        through the perspective that it is seen from.

        <p class="aboutDesc">
          One of my favorite hobbies includes drawing/sketching. I really love
          spending some of my time drawing with either a pen and paper or a tablet.
          I prefer traditional, however, as the pencil moving across the computer
          paper is incredibly relaxing. My best art comes from replicating a picture
          I see and recently I have gotten fond of drawing ducks. Another hobby
          is coding small games in pygame and soon, in Unity using C#. A few games
          that have been inspirations for me that I recommend are the
          <a href="https://yakuza.fandom.com/wiki/Yakuza_(series)" target="_blank">Yakuza Series</a>
          and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls">Dark Souls.</a>
          Yakuza has a dramatic undertone in its story while also
          presenting "minigames" to have fun with when you aren't progressing in
          the story, such as karaoke or bowling. Dark Souls is well known for balancing
          its challenging difficulty and engaging gameplay. Both games serve as
          great references for what makes a video game fun.

            is a game-ified workpout app. It allows for users to exercise on their own time 
            while also developing their stats in the app. The app takes the user and gives them 
            various "stats" that is usually seen in RPGs (role-playing games). These stats include 
            strength, stamina, and health. The more the user exercises, the more experience points 
            they get which will level them up. Each exercise will be displayed on their page for others to see. 
            The user has a choice between various exercises and the more time they take exercising, the more 
            experience they get towards leveling up themselves. 
            The app was built using Android Studio in a team of 4 and was awarded second place against 8 other teams.

            a budgeting website meant to give the user the freedom to design their monthly budget 
            however they want. Using various data visualization tools, the user is able to keep track 
            of how much of their budget they've spent compared to their monthly income. Anytime 
            the user is overbudget, the data visualization tools will show them that they need 
            to be careful. When inputting a transaction, the user has the ability to provide the name, 
            the category, price, date, and any notes they want to leave for themselves. The data is 
            stored using the MongoDB database and hosted using Heroku.

            Force</a> is a two-week group project that was presented at the
            Hunter College Codefest at Google. This Space Invader's themed project
            is an educational children's game, made in Python, meant to teach them
            one fun fact about each of the planets while also presenting a challenge.
            They only have three lives and shooting the wrong planet will cause
            a Game Over. Within the team behind the project, I had worked on the
            Object-Oriented Programing with one other member and a few design
            choices while the rest of the work had been split up with the other
            three members.
