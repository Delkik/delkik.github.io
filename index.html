      <h1 class="head">Hello!</h1>
      <hr class="brk me">
      <div class="aboutMe professional">

        <p class="aboutDesc">
        I'm Daniel Elkik, a Computer Science student in the Daedalus Scholars
        Program at Hunter College. I became attached to the field after realizing
        the versitality that accompanies coding. Anything is possible as long as
        I have a computer and my fingers to type. I'm interested in both Finance and Game
        Development. My motivation in life is to create projects through the medium
        of video games in order to inspire, and of course entertain, people
        of all ages and countries, especially when life becomes tough.
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-first-game-based-digital-therapeutic-improve-attention-function-children-adhd">
        Recently, the FDA approved a video game as a prescription for ADHD. </a> This is an incredible
        achievement, one that could finally end the negative stigma that surrounds
        video games and one that I would love to be a part of one day. So until then,
        I will continue coding and creating projects so I can reach this dream of mine.

      <!-- <div class="aboutMe personal">

        <p class="aboutDesc">
          One of my favorite hobbies includes drawing/sketching. I really love
          spending some of my time drawing with either a pen and paper or a tablet.
          I prefer traditional, however, as the pencil moving across the computer
          paper is incredibly relaxing. My best art comes from replicating a picture
          I see and recently I have gotten fond of drawing ducks. Another hobby
          is coding small games in pygame and soon, in Unity using C#. A few games
          that have been inspirations for me that I recommend are the
          <a href="https://yakuza.fandom.com/wiki/Yakuza_(series)" target="_blank">Yakuza Series</a>
          and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls">Dark Souls.</a>
          Yakuza has a dramatic undertone in its story while also
          presenting "minigames" to have fun with when you aren't progressing in
          the story, such as karaoke or bowling. Dark Souls is well known for balancing
          its challenging difficulty and engaging gameplay. Both games serve as
          great references for what makes a video game fun.

            <a href="https://github.com/Delkik/spaceForce" target="_blank">Space
             Force</a> is a two-week group project that was presented at the
            Hunter College Codefest at Google. This Space Invader's themed project
            is an educational children's game, made in Python, meant to teach them
            one fun fact about each of the planets while also presenting a challenge.
            They only have three lives and shooting the wrong planet will cause
            a Game Over. Within the team behind the project, I had worked on the
            Object-Oriented Programing with one other member and a few design
            choices while the rest of the work had been split up with the other
            three members.
